# Kinematic analysis of a planar 4-RPR robotic manipulator

## About
GUI programmed using MATLAB. 
Addresses:
  - Forward and Inverse Kinematics
  - Manipulability Measures (Yoshikawa and Isentropic)
  - Task space visualization
  - Open loop control
  - Close loop Joint space and Task space control

Equations and algorithms used to solve for the kinematics of this system
can be found in `4rpr-paper.pdf`

## Implementation

The program and GUI are writting using MATLAB. The source code can be found
in `src/`
